                <h2>Discover Taniti</h2>
                <p>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. [cite: 1] While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. The indigenous population is about 20,000.</p>

                <h3>Plan Your Tanitian Getaway</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Lodging:</strong> Taniti offers a wide variety of lodging, from an inexpensive hostel to a large, four-star resort, plus many small, family-owned hotels and bed and breakfasts. All lodging is strictly regulated and inspected by the Tanitian government. [cite: 8]</li>
                    <li><strong>Restaurants:</strong> There are 10 restaurants: five serve mostly local fish and rice, three offer American-style meals, and two serve Pan-Asian cuisine. </li>
                    <li><strong>Entertainment & Activities:</strong> Most visitors enjoy the beaches, exploring the rainforest, and visiting the volcano. [cite: 9] Other activities include a local history museum, chartered fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining, visiting pubs (including a microbrewery), a dance club, a movie theatre, helicopter rides, an arcade, art galleries, and bowling.  Many activities are located in Merriton Landing. Popular sightseeing includes Taniti City with its native architecture and white, sandy beaches, as well as boat or bus tours, rainforest hikes, and volcano visits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Most visitors arrive by air, with some arriving on a weekly cruise ship. The small airport serves small jets and propeller planes. Ground transportation includes public buses in Taniti City (5 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily), private buses for the rest of the island, taxis in Taniti City, and rental cars near the airport. Bikes (helmets required by law) are also available for rent. Taniti City is quite flat and walkable.</li>
